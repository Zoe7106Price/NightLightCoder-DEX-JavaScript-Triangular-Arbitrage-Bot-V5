JavaScript DEX Triangular Arbitrage Bot v5 is a software program that uses JavaScript programming language to automate the process of triangular arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Triangular arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves exploiting price discrepancies between three different cryptocurrencies on a single exchange.


The bot is designed to monitor the prices of three cryptocurrencies in real-time and execute trades automatically when the conditions for triangular arbitrage are met. It does this by analyzing the prices of the three cryptocurrencies and calculating whether a profitable trade can be made by buying and selling them in a specific order.


For example, if the bot detects that the price of cryptocurrency A is lower on the exchange than the price of cryptocurrency B, which is lower than the price of cryptocurrency C, it will execute a series of trades to take advantage of this price discrepancy. The bot will first buy cryptocurrency A, then sell it for cryptocurrency B, and finally sell cryptocurrency B for cryptocurrency C. If the prices are favorable, this process will result in a profit.
